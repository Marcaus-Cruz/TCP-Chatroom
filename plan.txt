Write you assignment plan here. Refer to the assignment PDF for details. Do not change this file name.


1) Write a one paragraph summary of the program in your own words.  What is being asked of you?  What will you implement in this assignment?

We are being asked to implement a sort of chatroom using the TCP protocol as we did in the last assignment. The server should be able to handle
up to 255 "participants" and 255 "observers". Each participant has only one observer associated with them at any point of their connection. 
As the names suggest, participants are able to chat with other participants and the observers are receiving the messages in real time but are not able to have a say in the conversation. Users are able to join and leave the chatroom at any point in time, and it should be shown to the clients who is
leaving or joining.

2) What you anticipate being the most challenging aspect of the assignment?

The most difficult aspect of this assignment seems like it's going to be using the select() method to monitor connections to the server because we've
are not familiar with it. Also, the complexity of the assignment (i.e. handling different events at any point in time) seems like it's going to be 
problematic. And, of course, the infinite loop consantly prompting participants for input will probably take us a good amount of time because of our
not-so-great experience with user input the last two projects.

3) Give a list of at least three resources you plan to draw from if you get stuck on something.

Prof. Shri, Project specification, Google, Stack Overflow, Project 2, Man pages

4) What is your plan for meeting to finish this program (e.g. ``every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 3pm-5pm until it's done.).

Tuesday - Thursday or Sunday at any time that works with both schedules. We plan to be communicative about everything to ensure it's completion.
